            <h2 id="header1">History</h2>
            <p id="p1">Juventus Football Club S.p.A. commonly referred to as Juventus and colloquially as Juve is a professional Italian association football club based in Turin, Piedmont. The club is the third oldest of its kind in the country and has spent the majority of its history, with the exception of the 2006–07 season, in the top flight First Division (known as Serie A since 1929).</p>
            <p id="p2">Founded in 1897 as Sport Club Juventus by a group of young Torinese students among them, who was their first president, Eugenio Canfari, and his brother Enrico, author of the company's historical memory. They have been managed by the industrial Agnelli family since 1923, which constitutes the oldest sporting partnership in Italy, thus making Juventus the first professional club in the country.</p>
        <p id="p3">Over time, the club has become a symbol of the nation's Italianità 
                   ("Italianness"),due to their tradition of success, some 
                    of which have had a significant impact in Italian society, especially in 
                    the 1930s and the first post-war decade; and the ideological politics 
                    and socio-economic origin of the club's sympathisers. This is reflected, 
                    among others, in the club's contribution to the national team, uninterrupted 
                    since the second half of the 1920s and recognised as one of the most influential 
                    in international football, having performed a decisive role in the World Cup triumphs 
                    of 1934, 1982 and 2006. The club's fan base is larger than any other Italian 
                    football club and is one of the largest worldwide. Support for Juventus is widespread 
                    throughout the country and abroad, mainly in countries with a significant presence of 
                    Italian immigrants.
                    
                    Juventus is historically the most successful club in 
                    Italian football and one of the most laureated and important 
                    globally. Overall, they have won fifty-nine official titles on the national 
                    and international stage, more than any other Italian club: a record thirty-one official league titles,
                    a record ten Italian cups, a record seven national super cups, and, with eleven titles in confederation and 
                    inter-confederation competitions (two Intercontinental Cups, two European Champion Clubs' Cup/UEFA Champions
                    Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups, one UEFA Intertoto Cup and two UEFA Super Cups) the club 
                    ranks fourth in Europe and eighth in the world with the most trophies won.</p>
